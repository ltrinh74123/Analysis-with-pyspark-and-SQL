# Big-Data-using-SQL-in-Databricks-VS-Postgres
Here is where I explored the differences between using SQL on PostgresSQL and Databricks. The reports were done as a team and I had marked my own code inside each html file. The entity relationship diagram is shown below.

We had 2 assignments - each having 2 task:
  1. Our first assignmnet was to write queries for Postgres and Databricks and compare the execution plans and time. Admittedly, I had initally misread the second task and wrote the SQL code that works for both databricks and postgres, when I only needed to write a code for either of them. I did one indivudal question and a team question
  2. Our second one required rewriting a given SQL query into a pyspark code, and then writing our own pyspark query to answer a question. Each code had to have an optimised version. I did the code for the first question and wrote the unoptimised code for the second one.
